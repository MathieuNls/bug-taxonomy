\subsection{What are the proportions of different types of bugs?}

\input{tabs/bugProportion}

Table \ref{tab:contingency-table} presents a contingency table and the results of the Pearson's chi-squared tests we performed on each types of bug.
In addition to presenting bug types 1 to 4,  Table \ref{tab:contingency-table} also presents regroupement of bug types:
Types 1 and 2 versus Types 3 and 4.

Types 3 (22.6\% and 54\%) and 4 (31.3\% and 64.9\%) are predominants compared to types 1 (14.3\% and 9.1\%) and 2 (6.8\% and 3.7\%) for the Apache and the Netbeans ecosystems, respectively.
Obviously, this observation also holds for when the two ecosystems are combined.
Overall, the proportion of different types of bug is as follows: 6.8\%, 3.7\%, 28.3\%, 61.2\% for types 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The result of the Pearson's tests are bellow 0.01.
As a reminder, we consider results of Pearson's tests statistically significant at $\alpha \textless0.05$.
Consequently, we reject to null hypothesis $H_{01}$ and conclude that there is a predominance of Types 3 and 4 in all different ecosystems and this observation is not related to a specific ecosystem.
When combined into our first group, Types 1 \& 2 versus. Types 3 \& 4, there are significantly more Types 3 and 4 (89.5 \%) than Types 1 and 2 (10.5 \%).
