\subsection{What are the proportions of different types of bugs?}

\input{tabs/bugProportion}

Table \ref{tab:contingency-table} presents a contingency table and the results of the Pearson's chi-squared tests we performed on each types of bug.
In addition to presenting bug types 1 to 4,  Table \ref{tab:contingency-table} also presents grouping of bug types:
Types 1 and 2 versus Types 3 and 4.

Types 3 (22.6\% and 54\%) and 4 (31.3\% and 64.9\%) are predominant compared to types 1 (14.3\% and 9.1\%) and 2 (6.8\% and 3.7\%) for the Apache and the Netbeans ecosystems, respectively.
Overall, the proportion of different types of bug is as follows: 6.8\%, 3.7\%, 28.3\%, 61.2\% for types 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The result of the Pearson's test is below 0.01.
As a reminder, we consider results of Pearson's tests statistically significant at $\alpha \textless0.05$.
Consequently, we reject to null hypothesis $H_{01}$ and conclude that there is a predominance of Types 3 and 4 in all different ecosystems and this observation is not related to a specific ecosystem.
When combined into our first group, Types 1 \& 2 versus Types 3 \& 4, there are significantly more Types 3 and 4 (89.5 \%) than Types 1 and 2 (10.5 \%).
