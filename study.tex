\section{Study Design}

The goal of this study is to analyse the location of bug fixes, with the purpose of classifying bug fixes into types.
More specifically, this study aims to answer the following two research questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf RQ$_1$:} {\it What are the proportions of different types of bugs?} This research question aims to identify the extent to which bugs can be classified according to their fix-locations and the proportion of each types.
  Specifically, we investigate if different types of bugs exist at all and if the proportion of different types in non-negligible.
  As discussed earlier [WAHAB: Please run a spell checker], knowing, for example, that bugs of Type 3 and 4 are the most predominant ones suggests that we need to investigate techniques to help detect whether an incoming bug is of Types 3 and 4 by examining historical data.
  Similarly, if we can automatically identify a bug that is related to another one that has been fixed then we can reuse the results of reproducing the first bug in reproducing the second one.

	\item {\bf RQ$_2$:} {\it How complex is each type of bugs?} This second research question aims to investigate the complexity of the different types of bug.
  More specifically, we analyse  the complexity of different types of bugs using code and process metrics both.
  For the code aspect of the complexity, we compute the number of different files impacted by the fix and the number of hunks and churns.
  We do not compute any statical complexity metrics such as cyclomatic complexity \cite{McCabe1989}.
  For the process aspect of complexity, we analyse the severity of a bug, the number of duplicate bug reports submitted, the number of times a bug report is reopened, the number of commits [WAHAB: Do you mean commits?], and the time required to fix the bug.
